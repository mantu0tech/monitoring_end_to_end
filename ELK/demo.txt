let's see how to install ELK on AWS and use it 

elk architecture 

server >data collection >> logstash >> Elastic search >> kibana 

select ubuntu ec2 >> t2 medium > 30 gb storage 
launch it 

sudo apt update 

sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk >> for ELK java is IMP 

sudo apt update 
sudo apt install nginx 

wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/9.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-9.x.list

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch kibana logstash filebeat 

it will downlaod evertgin 

verify nwow 

java --version 
sudo systemctl status nginx 

 sudo systemctl start  elasticsearch kibana logstash filebeat

  sudo systemctl status  elasticsearch kibana logstash filebeat

   sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch kibana logstash filebeat

   now lets see how to use it!!

   sudo vi "/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml"
change all these thign in the file 
   
   cluster.name: my-application
   node.name: node-1
   network.host: localhost
   http.port: 9200

now save and exit 

sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch.service
reatet it 

it is working in port no 9200

sudo vi /etc/kibana/kibana.yml

server.host: "localhost"
server.port: 5601

uncomment these 2 line nad save it 
sudo systemctl restart kibana

we are going to add the username and password in nginx so we can access the kibana 

sudo apt install apache2-utils 

sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/htpasswd.users kibana 
htpasword hash the password 
/etc/nginx/htpasswd.users username ans password will store 

it will ask you to enter the password 

 sudo cat /etc/nginx/htpasswd.users
 you  can see your password is stored in hash way 

 username kibana
 password kibana 

 sudo mv /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/backup

 sudo mv /etc/nginx/sites-available/default 

sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
 server {
    listen 80;

    server_name <Instance-Public IP>;

    auth_basic "Restricted Access";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/htpasswd.users;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5601;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

add these in your now save and exit 
sudo systemctl restart nginx 

now paster your ip to the browser it will ask u user name and apssword 
kibana and kibana 
it will load  your elastic search 


sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
it will take few minutes and it will generate the d=tocker for you 
eyJ2ZXIiOiI4LjE0LjAiLCJhZHIiOlsiMTcyLjMxLjMwLjE3Njo5MjAwIl0sImZnciI6ImI0MmNmZjc4YTY4MzNkMjk4MDYxMTI2YmU5MTUxMTkyZjAyNjc0YTM2MjBkNDg3YjhjMGRlOGE5ZGUxYTA2OWUiLCJrZXkiOiJpU0pNcUp3QjNCb25lbDEydXdOMTpyd0NGM0JwSldvbVQ4REc5LVdnU09BIn0=
now paster the code then it will ask your for the otp 

 sudo /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-verification-code

 it will give you the code paste it on the kibana 

 after few minutes your kibana will be ready 

 after that go to hmoe 
 try our sample data 

 here you can play with the sample data 
 we are going to use the sample web logs 

 install it 

 go to menue >> dashboard > it will show you the logs that your downlaod 

 explore it 

 change the time frame 
 share it and enjoy 

 now lets collect our own data and visualize it 

 now we are using the file beat and collect the logs 

 sudo filebeat modules list 

 sudo filebeat modules enable system 

 these is how you can enable the system 

 now we are goint the collect the system log and visualize it 

 sudo vi /etc/filebeat/modules.d/system.yml


 now in that 
  inside the syslog add these command 

  enabled: true 
  var.paths:["/var/log/syslog*"]

  now paste the same in auth

  var.paths:["/var/log/auth.log*"] 

now save it 

clear 
now restart the filebeat 
sudo systemctl restart filebeat 
if not work stop and start agin 

now go ot browser 

left side >> look for management > stack management 
index management >>your data is here 
file beat > click and check the info 
these is where your system logs is stored 


look for kibana > index pattern >>create index patter >>
name it 
filebeat*
select index >> click on next > and clic k on create 

now go insdie it and check it 

now to create a dashboard 
go to left side >> visualize >> create >select pia chart > select the file beat >>
ad visualize it 

here you can see the graph 
these is how your can use it 

sve it and add 
and in the same manner you can add multiple and your are done !!

to download the dashboard 
sudo filebeat setup -e 

enter it and you can see the
it wil ldownlaod the dashboard
